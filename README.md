# VerraVoice
VerraVoice is a Discord bot built for Ashes of Creation realm-servers. It tracks settlements, tiers, mayors, and elections, manages mayor roles and channels, and delivers clear announcements for level-ups, wars, and elections. VerraVoice keeps realms informed, organized, and in sync with Verra’s world.
